                            My school journey began with nursery at the Day Care Center near our house in Lanao Del Norte when I was four. When my father found a stable job in Cebu, Lapu-Lapu City, my family and I moved there to continue our lives. I was then enrolled in Canjualo Elementary School for kindergarten.

                            Through six years of elementary school, I built memorable moments with classmates and teachers‚Äîmy "second family." I found myself embracing school as a second home. I have big dreams in life, and I am working hard to achieve them by doing my best in school. My ultimate goal is to be successful and pay back my parents for their constant support and sacrifice.
